        <p>I&#39;ve done some exciting things in the world of commerce since my last post. After <a href="http://www.pumpingstationone.org/">Pumping Station: One</a> got a laser cutter I started cutting stuff from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a> and thinking of products I could make with it.  I fixed the Thingiverse files for Tetris blocks and made some of those.  Then I thought of making glasses out of the <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/%E0%B2%A0%E0%B2%A0-look-of-disapproval">Look of Disapproval</a> from reddit.  Then Gretchen wanted me to make her something on the laser, so I made her a pendant with the kiss emoticon.  After a while I put all these things on my etsy store, <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/opticalawesome">Optical Awesome</a>.  The <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/79821028/look-of-disapproval-glasses">Look of Disapproval Glasses</a> started really taking off, and I&#39;ve now sold over 150 of them!  Exciting stuff.  I&#39;ve decided to move all my e-commerce to etsy since they make it so easy and deliver me traffic through their search.</p>
<p>I also sold things at Maker Faire NY, which was great.  My necklaces and t-shirts were big hits and I just about made enough money to cover the expenses of the trip. (Lesson #1, don&#39;t dig so big a hole that you have to have a ton of success to get back out of it.)  I kept track of a few things I started out doing wrong and did my best to fix on the spot, so hopefully those mistakes won&#39;t happen again: </p>

<ol>
<li>Post a price or people don&#39;t know it&#39;s for sale.  With all the makers just exhibiting things, it&#39;s easy to get confused.</li>
<li>If you put t-shirts out on a table people will look through them for their size.  Either have sizes out there or hang them up behind you.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t underestimate the number of girls there.  I didn&#39;t think necklaces would sell well, but a ton of girls came by and loved them.</li>
<li>People loved trying on the look of disapproval glasses and sending pics to their friends.  If I had a kiosk to do that it would be nice for collecting emails.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also I got a bunch of new product ideas from people coming up to my table.  I haven&#39;t acted on them yet, soon though!</p>
