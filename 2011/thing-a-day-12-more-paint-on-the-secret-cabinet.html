        <p>I put another coat of paint on the secret cabinet project. The reason this is taking so long is that I&#39;d like to get it smoothed out to a mirror finish. I&#39;m starting to get frustrated with that though. I keep putting on more paint and sanding but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m making any progress. Here are some of the problems I think I&#39;m having: </p>

<ol>
<li>I&#39;m using a paint brush.  When I bought the paint I asked the Home Depot guy what the best way to get a really smooth finish was.  He said either a Purdy brand brush or a foam roller.  I went with the brush since the cabinet is small and the tray is more of a hassle.  I think that was a mistake.  A brush will always leave stroke marks in the surface, and that has to be sanded out.  I&#39;m going to switch to a foam roller tomorrow.</li>
<li>I&#39;m not sanding properly.  I don&#39;t know what grit of paper to use at which level of roughness, and committing the elbow grease to try something for it to be a failure is eating up too much time.  I&#39;m going to get a sander and try some lower grits.</li>
</ol>
