        <p>So obviously I haven&#39;t kept up with my thing-a-day blog posts. I&#39;ve still been doing some things but not every day, and all those knitting days during the weeks were disenchanting. I&#39;ve decided to cover everything in one big wrap up post for the month. I &ldquo;finished&rdquo; the secret cabinet project. The cabinet is an &ldquo;emergency documentation box&rdquo; for Pumping Station: One. It&#39;s mounted near the soon to be new home for Electric Avenue in a fairly prominent place and contains a flip video camera graciously donated by Anne Petersen. Now there&#39;s no excuse to not have video of the culmination of your awesome project. This camera really couldn&#39;t be any easier to use, so I hope this box helps out the space. I said it&#39;s &ldquo;finished&rdquo; because I really just got tired of working on it and moved on. There should be some lettering on the window but I&#39;ll add it later. </p>

<p>I implemented the <a href="http://www.woodbutcher.net/scary.shtml">scary sharp</a> tool sharpening system and sharpened a chisel and a hand plane. I sharpened them down to 1000 grit sandpaper and I intended to go down to 2000 but after seeing how amazing the results are with 1000 I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary. </p>

<p>I produced a video of a Sun Jar for Element14. They approached PS:One a while back to send someone and record some of our projects and they got a good response from the video, so they asked for more. I hope it&#39;s the first of a long series. </p>

<p>I and several other members <a href="http://pumpingstationone.org/2011/02/workshop-build-out-take-one/">built three workbenches</a> for the new shop in Pumping Station: One. It&#39;s always fun to do those kind of large scale builds, but we could certainly use more tools so more people can work at once. </p>

<p>I still have plenty more projects on my list of stuff I could do this month and a few more cool things have popped up, so keep an eye out for weekend projects in March!</p>
