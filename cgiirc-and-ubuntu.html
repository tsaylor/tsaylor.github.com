        <p>I don&#39;t like using Pidgin(Gaim) or Mirc for an irc client when I&#39;m on windows, and I&#39;d rather just not bother having a client on whatever machine I&#39;m using in general, so I usually install <a href="http://cgiirc.org/">cgi::irc</a> on a server and use that. I recently reinstalled Ubuntu on my server and had to reinstall cgi::irc. After that, when I tried to connect to any server I kept getting the error:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>
***Access Denied: No connections allowed  
</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried to find an error log somewhere on the system but there wasn&#39;t one. Eventually I grepped the source for &ldquo;No connections allowed&rdquo; and found it on line 715 of nph-irc.cgi. This is in the code to handle ip access restrictions. So I go to the config file and find a file called &ldquo;ipaccess&rdquo; which only contains a rule to allow connections from 127.0.0.1. This was the problem. I didn&#39;t care about ip restrictions, so I went to the main config file and commented out the line:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>
ip_access_file = ipaccess  
</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I can log in to my cgi::irc no problem. I could also have added more rules to &ldquo;ipaccess&rdquo;, but I didn&#39;t want to fiddle with it, and I&#39;d probably end up with the same situation as I have now.   </p>
<p>It&#39;s important to note that the <strong>default Ubuntu (7.04 Feisty Fawn)</strong> cgi::irc package comes configured like this and doesn&#39;t tell you that you have to change it in order to make it useful. Maybe this should have a configuration prompt on installation as is done with packages like Postfix.</p>
