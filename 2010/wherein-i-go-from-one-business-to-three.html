        <p>A few months ago I decided that I wasn&#39;t going to tolerate excuses any more and it was time to get started with my own business.  Since that time nothing has gone as I planned, but my quest to owning a business couldn&#39;t be developing any better.  I have my hands in three different businesses right now. The first is <a href="http://www.ruggedscents.com/">RuggedScents</a>.  I mentioned this a little bit in my last post.  <a href="http://www.chemhacker.com/">Sacha De&#39;Angeli</a> and I started this business half as a goof to enter in the BARcompany competition at <a href="http://www.barcampchicago.com/">BARcamp Chicago</a> 2010.  Surprisingly we won the competition, so we used the prize money to develop a production process and start selling our line of masculine colognes. We have the process figured out for our first product; Smoque, a campfire scented cologne.  Our products will be available for purchase soon. The next one to come along was <a href="http://www.makertees.com/">Maker Tees</a>, though it has its roots in some things I did much earlier in the year.  Pumping Station: One wanted to sell logo t-shirts, but nobody was interested in making that happen.  As they were crippled by indecision, a group of members including myself stumbled upon a separate awesome t-shirt idea, the &ldquo;Sir, I Practise Hacking&rdquo; shirt.  I had no choice but to have those shirts made, and since I was doing it already I made the Pumping Station: One shirts too.  I carried around a big box of shirts, selling them in person until I broke even, then I temporarily dropped out of the t-shirt business.  The process was so simple and appealing though that I decided to take it larger scale and sell a wide variety of maker themed shirts, and seek to sell shirts on behalf of hackerspaces. Finally, I&#39;m a big part of another venture that&#39;s just getting some momentum.  A few months ago I had the idea that a social network for hackerspace members could be very popular and useful.  I mentioned this to a fellow PS:One member Jordan Bunker, and that mention along with some discussions he had with the <a href="http://www.schoolfactory.org/content/space-federation-overview">Space Federation</a> led to us working out a set of features, a few possible business models, and deciding to actually build it.  We will be building this software and developing the community around it in the coming months, and with sponsorship from the Space Federation we may actually get paid to make it. This is definitely a very exciting, and far too busy, time in my life.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#28" title="2010-10-27 16:39:48">Christopher Allan Webber</a>:</strong> Instead of making a new social network software, how about hopping on the StatusNet bandwagon (or at least use its federated service, OStatus)?</p>
<p><strong><a href="#29" title="2010-10-28 08:30:34">tsaylor</a>:</strong> That&#39;s definitely something on our radar. There are a couple of other services we&#39;ve also discovered that we plan to integrate to avoid reinventing wheels. Thanks for the suggestion!</p>
