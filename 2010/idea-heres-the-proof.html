        <p>People are always making wild claims on the internet. Herestheproof.com would give them a canonical resource for evidence of their claims. Anyone could start <someclaim>.herestheproof.com and list their evidence. Other people can edit the page until the evidence is optimized. Then the information is easily accessible in a debate, for reporting, etc. There&#39;s still some problems with this idea. First, how do you ensure the evidence is real? With no direct debater there&#39;s no one on point to dispute the credibility of evidence. The reader can do this themselves but that shouldn&#39;t go on too long. There could be a wiki tag to show that a particular piece of evidence is disputed. That would create a claim page for the claim that the evidence is false. Also, this is vulnerable to spam. It literally invites things like &ldquo;extenze-makes-your-penis-bigger.herestheproof.com&rdquo;.Â  I don&#39;t know if I consider this a problem. That is a legitimate claim, and the &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; would be disputed if any were provided as for any other claim. There could also be totally unrelated content added as evidence for a claim. Crowdsourcing and backend behavior tracking algorithms could help solve this problem. Overall, many of the problems this would have are similar to ones experienced by wikipedia, so that would be the place to look for solutions. Please leave me comments with your thoughts on this idea. I&#39;m unsure if there&#39;s enough differentiation from existing resources for this to be worth pursuing, but I haven&#39;t spent much time thinking this through yet.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#23" title="2010-01-18 16:44:44">Nathan</a>:</strong> How would this be different from Snopes for example?</p>
<p><strong><a href="#24" title="2010-01-19 09:24:52">Jacques</a>:</strong> Not a bad idea, but it&#39;d take a lot to get it going when snopes.com and wikipedia are out there. The latter being crowd-sourced, the former handling people doing real checks. The biggest issue I&#39;m seeing is that the crowd you&#39;re targeting would be people trying to prove things, not just the general public looking for information. So you run the risk of attracting a higher number of conspiracy theorists than those who are actually informed. I personally wouldn&#39;t use subdomains for each proof as much as something like herestheproof.com/something_I_can_prove, but I&#39;ve never really been one for using subdomains as something dynamic. I know it can be done just as easily (URL Rewrites, etc.), it&#39;s just not my style. Other possible domain names: proveit, proven,</p>
<p><strong><a href="#25" title="2010-01-20 11:50:43">Dan</a>:</strong> Not sure this is different enough from Wikipedia to really catch on.</p>
