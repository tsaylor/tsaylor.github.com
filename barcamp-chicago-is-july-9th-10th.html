        <p>I&#39;ve been hard at work for the last couple months helping to get <a href="http://www.barcampchicago.org/">BARcamp Chicago</a> put together this year.  We&#39;re hosting it at Pumping Station: One on the weekend of July 9th and 10th, and as always the event is free and there will be food and drinks provided (and not just pizza, we&#39;ll be grilling hamburgers and hot dogs on site). If you&#39;ve never been to BARcamp or to any unconference before, you should definitely come check it out.  The weekend will be filled with a wide variety of technology and entrepreneurship talks given by attendees.  If you have some knowledge you&#39;d like to share, you can give a talk too! We&#39;re also repeating the BARcompany contest.  Last year we had three companies present business plans and prototypes, and the winner, Sacha DeAngeli of <a href="http://www.ruggedscents.com/">RuggedScents</a>, has now launched his third manly scented cologne and has revenue coming in.  This year we have three experienced judges and a cash prize for the winner, so start thinking about something you&#39;d like to make. I know I&#39;m excited for BARcamp this year, and I hope you are too!  For more info, check out our website at <a href="http://www.barcampchicago.org/">http://www.barcampchicago.org/</a> or follow us on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/barcampchi">twitter</a>.</p>
