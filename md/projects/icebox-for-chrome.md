# Icebox for Chrome

I wanted to build a tool that safely stored web sites I wanted to revisit without
keeping a tab open. Open tabs take up resources and clutter your mind. I wanted
to make it decentralized too, not aggregate all the data in a server. Working on
this helped me clarify my thoughts about "small data".
