# ORDclub

I wanted a better way to get to know people at an event so I know who to seek
out and talk to. Given a twitter list of event attendees, this app makes it easy
to browse their bios and see who you want to make sure you meet. Future plans included
recommendations based on tweeted keywords and links.
