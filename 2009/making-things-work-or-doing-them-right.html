        <p>When I&#39;m trying to figure out how to get my CSS styles to render properly there are usually a number of possible solutions that &ldquo;work&rdquo;. I sometimes have trouble deciding which one is the best: the one with the most concise CSS? The one with the least entanglement with the HTML? It can be hard to know which way is &ldquo;right&rdquo;. While I was working on the <a href="http://timsaylor.com/portfolio/">portfolio</a> on this site, I had a problem like this. I wanted to float the screen shot to the left so the text would wrap around it, but I had to get the container for each screenshot/description to actually encapsulate them so its external spacing would line up properly. The usual way I knew to do it was to put another element in there that cleared the float so the container would be forced down where I want it. However this seems hackish and entangles the display with the content more than I like, so I looked for a better way. I found a page on the subject of <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/clearing.html">clearing floats</a> and immediately I could see that the solution described there was the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to do it. It&#39;s simple, unentangling, and above all it works. This is one I&#39;ll have to remember for next time.</p>
