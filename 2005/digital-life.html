        <p>This is fairly old now, but some <a href="http://devolab.cse.msu.edu/">students at MSU developed a simulated world platform</a> where virus-like program/organisms fight for survival and control of limited resources. This combined with random changes to their code creates evolution. Their platform is called Avida. I ran it for a little while and it was kind of cool, but I didn&#39;t know how to use it to it&#39;s full potential so I couldn&#39;t see how cool it really was.   </p>
<p>My biggest problem with it is that they&#39;re calling it an instance of evolution and they&#39;re saying it could be used to develop solutions to problems we don&#39;t know how to solve yet. I disagree. From what I read it appears they have to set up rewards artificially, and these have to trigger when certain milestones are reached. That can&#39;t be done for problems we don&#39;t know how to solve because we don&#39;t know what&#39;s closer or further from the proper solution. Also, with each step being rewarded we&#39;re not really talking about evolution anymore, it&#39;s much more like intelligent design. Greyhounds didn&#39;t evolve naturally, they were bred through centuries of dog racing to be skinny and fast. These skills didn&#39;t necessarily help them survive, but they helped them win races for their owners. That&#39;s the difference here too: the scientists are providing the end goal and essentially &ldquo;breeding&rdquo; the viruses to reach the goal.  </p>
<p>Despite my problems with it, I&#39;ll be very interested to see where they go with their work.</p>
