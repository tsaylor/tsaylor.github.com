            <![CDATA[ <p>I am a software developer. I have always worked for small to medium sized companies, between roughly 10 and 100 people. When I first started my professional career, I had been trained to write good software. I learned about software development processes, programming languages, databases, testing, algorithms, requirements, and all sorts of things that make me better at writing software. I was hired as a software developer and was assigned software to write, so I wrote it to the best of my ability. </p>
<p>But that’s all I did, I wrote good software. And by itself, that’s worthless.  </p>
<p>I write software to get paid, and that money comes from customers paying for products or services. When I write software, I do it as a part of a larger human system that takes customer problems, builds solutions for them, and sells the solutions so we can all keep getting paychecks. If any part of the human system stops working, the paychecks stop coming. </p>
<p>The first time I was confronted with this reality I was working on a team with one other developer and a project manager. In every status meeting we reported that we were on track to deliver the product on time, but when that time came we discovered that the other developer had a different definition of “done” than the rest of us. The product was late and we lost some future business from that customer. The blame for that failure was mostly laid on the other developer, but a little of the blame went to everyone. We should have been integrating our code the whole time. We should have demoed it to each other, or reviewed each other’s code. Doing those things would have exposed the problem much earlier. Beyond our assigned jobs, we all had the responsibility to ensure that everyone else was doing their job so the human system would be working properly for the client. </p>
<p>When you begin to consider the whole company as a human system, you can break it down into components and measure it like an engineering problem. (It will be an oversimplification, but it will do for our purposes.) </p>

<ul>
<li>Marketing’s job is to find random people most likely to buy your product and make sure they know about it and where to find it.</li>
<li>Sales often has two functions, taking random people and converting them to contacts, and later, showing those contacts how your product can improve their lives so they buy it.</li>
<li>Product Management takes data about customer problems, desires, and psychology, and creates a set of product requirements that meet customer needs, while still respecting business realities.</li>
<li>Technology turns product requirements into a working software product, and keeps it working when customers start using it.</li>
<li>Customer Service receives customer problems and complaints, keeps them working when the technology fails, and feeds info to product management when the product doesn’t meet their needs.</li>
<li>Finance tracks the money coming in, and makes sure it exceeds the money going out.</li>
<li>Management motivates employees to do their job, makes sure they have what they need, and keeps roadblocks and distractions out of their way.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these functions are required to keep customers happy. They aren’t always manifested in separate groups of people, but the tasks exist at every product company. If your company is lacking any one of them then you’re running on borrowed time. It’s essential to restore that function before the paychecks stop. That’s explicitly management’s job, but if you see the problem and don’t bring it to management for a solution you may be looking at the seeds of your own unemployment.</p>

            <![CDATA[ <p>A while back I saw <a href="http://vimeo.com/48437619">Emerson Spartz speak at Technori Pitch</a>, and one minor thing he said (about 7:30 in) stuck in my head. He reads a ton, and when he finds something he wants to remember he reads it again the next week, the next month, and every six months after that. It sounded like a good idea. I wanted a tool to help me do that, so I made one. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.savethisfor.me">Save This For Me</a> saves whatever you give it and emails it to you on a decaying schedule: two days, one week, 30 days, and every 180 days after you save it. The content is written in markdown, so you have flexibility to add rich content while being fairly friendly to articles pasted from the web. </p>
<p>I mostly wrote this because I want to use it, but I hope other people want to use it too.  I have ideas for improving it too, but there&#39;s not much use in improving it too much if nobody else finds it useful, so I&#39;m releasing it now as a minimum viable product.  Please give it a try and send me feedback by email or twitter, or as a comment on this post.</p>

        <content type="html" xml:base="http://www.timsaylor.com/" xml:lang="en">
            <![CDATA[ <p>I’ve been thinking lately about my body of work.  Everything a person does adds up to tell the story of what they care about and what they accomplished.  I’ve never really kept track of this at any more granularity than a resumé, and I think that’s a problem.  It leads to forgetting what you’ve done, and losing track of your major goals.  Memory is fallible, and with enough time I’ll forget all but the broadest strokes of what I’ve done.  A person’s expertise is based on their history of doing things and what they learned from it, and the less they remember of that history the less expertise they have.  Also, looking back at a list of accomplishments gives a new perspective on how they fit in to a person’s major goals, and that insight can inform what future actions will help reach those goals. </p>
<p>So what did I do in 2013?</p>

<ul>
<li>I let my term on PS: One’s Board of Directors expire and stepped away from daily management for a while.  I’ve always found it hard to not help run the hackerspace, but doing so was important for me in learning to let others take things over and drop them from my mental space.  It gives me more time to work on what’s important instead of what’s urgent.</li>
<li>I created PS: One’s first annual budget in April.  It was grueling and well outside my expertise but I believed it was a major step toward transparency and fiscal responsibility for the organization.</li>
<li>I improved the wood shop certification and safety standards and certified many people, making it safer for the users and the tools.</li>
<li>I developed and taught an introduction to woodworking class.  This was a big one for me because I tend to collect knowledge on things I’m interested in and not use it enough.  Teaching classes seems like a great way to put that knowledge to work and make money in the process.</li>
<li>I helped the Chicago Public Library develop a makerspace in the Harold Washington branch downtown.  There wasn’t a lot of direct work for me on this task, I was just on their board of advisors and helped them figure out what a makerspace should be.</li>
<li>I really learned how Agile works, and started with continuous deployment.  This really started when I joined Analyte Health in September 2012.  I wanted to work there because they we&#39;re the best Agile python shop I’d heard of in Chicago.  Since joining I&#39;ve had a lot of hands on experience developing using the agile method.</li>
</ul>
<p>One problem with this list is that too many things were just whatever was in front of me.  Aside from the woodworking class and the budget, I just did whatever was convenient.  I&#39;ve relied too much on opportunities presenting themselves and I haven&#39;t been making my own opportunities to build the body of work I really want. </p>
<p>To that end, my goals for 2014 are: </p>

<ul>
<li>Take more control of my career path.  I&#39;ve been a developer for about 10 years and I&#39;ve never been in a senior position.  I think this is mostly because I&#39;ve moved to better companies and been surrounded by increasingly excellent coworkers, and also into a slightly different job as a consultant, but it&#39;s time I took a serious look at what it will take to get into a more senior position.</li>
<li>Start a curated kit subscription service.  I&#39;ve already started this a little bit.  It&#39;s an idea for a business enabling parents who want their kids to learn about making things to regularly receive kits curated by me, along with support when they make the kit if they have any problems.  Almost everyone I&#39;ve talked to has been very positive on the idea, and I already have kits selected.  The next step is to simply get started and learn what the customers want.</li>
<li>Make more art.  I had a realization last year that caused me to value artistic expression considerably more.  It was further emphasized by all the amazing people at XOXO.  I have a few ideas I&#39;d like to make, and I think it&#39;s important and will be rewarding.</li>
<li>Blog more.  Part of the difference between having 10 years of experience and 1 year of experience 10 times is remembering what you did.  Writing it down in a blog helps.  Also, I have ideas or get inspiration and keep it to myself too often.  I have pages upon pages in evernote with links and images and project ideas that are doing nobody any good as long as they stay buried.</li>
<li>Most importantly, do.  Don&#39;t allow television or video games to distract me from doing things that are more worthwhile.</li>
</ul>

            <![CDATA[ <p>Carrying my bike emergency stuff is a perennial pain point for me. I have to bring it with me when I lock up the bike to avoid theft, but I usually don&#39;t carry a bag I can stash it in. Inspired by some bags I saw made by <a href="//twitter.com/thenorasaurus">@thenorasaurus</a>, I made a similar one of my own. Here it is in use. </p>
<p><img src="/static/2014/LX80c.jpg" alt="Bike bag in use"/></p>
<p>The bag is an ordinary rectangular shape, but the sides aren&#39;t sewn all the way up to the zipper. There&#39;s some extra room for the zipper flaps to reach around the top tube, so it hangs by the same zipper that keeps it closed.</p>
<p><img src="/static/2014/9AtLY8o-Imgur.jpg" alt="bike bag"/></p>
<p>It&#39;s big enough to hold my lights, fix-a-flat kit, pants leg strap, and if I removed the notebooks it would fit a spare tube. Everything I need for my bike while riding around town.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#43" title="2013-03-04 11:19:27">Dan</a>:</strong> Did you design that yourself as well? I haven&#39;t kept up with all you&#39;ve been working on lately but that might be worth trying to put on Etsy. What kind of wood is that? It looks kindof thick. Also I don&#39;t really notice burn marks.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#44" title="2013-03-04 11:40:13">tsaylor</a>:</strong> Yeah, designed myself. It&#39;s actually corrugated cardboard. I intend to use wood later but this was just a prototype. I could etsy it but it&#39;s another cheap product that requires shipping; if I&#39;m going to ship products to people they&#39;re going to be expensive.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#45" title="2013-03-04 12:01:18">Dan</a>:</strong> Cheap to produce, maybe. I bet it could sell for more than those glasses, though maybe with a very high volume.</p>

<p>The top one was ground from a blank of O1 tool steel and heat treated. It&#39;s sitting on a blank of oak that&#39;s going to become its handle.

<p>The bottom one was forged from a railroad spike, formed on a grinding wheel and finished / sharpened at the belt sander. It&#39;s not good knife metal, it&#39;s just a project to get started at blacksmithing. And it looks purdy.</p>

        <content type="html" xml:base="http://www.timsaylor.com/" xml:lang="en">
            <![CDATA[ <p>I have a form with dynamic fields, meaning the answers available for field B depend on the answer for field A.  Therefore, when the form is submitted I get the value from field B, but when it&#39;s redisplayed I have to read the value from field A and populate the choices for field B or else field B is blanked out in the browser. I looked for a convenient way to read the bound data from a specified form field and was surprised that I couldn&#39;t find one.  I could just read the POST, but this form is in a formset with a prefix, so I&#39;d have to assemble a complicated key name like &ldquo;foo_bar_form-1-fieldname&rdquo;.  The closest I saw to an interface to get the data was the _raw_value(fieldname) method which I couldn&#39;t get to work and is suboptimal since it&#39;s an internal call and could change in the future. I ended up having to go to the POST data anyway, but I saw a helper function in _raw_value(fieldname) that made it easier.  What I ended up doing was this: </p>

<pre><code>field_value = self.request.POST[form.add_prefix('fieldname')]</code></pre>
<p>add_prefix(fieldname) is a public method to take care of the prefix hassle for me, so reading the post value is doable.  The only thing to watch out for is that you have to handle potential invalid values when redisplaying a form with errors.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#38" title="2012-08-16 16:57:38">Cezar</a>:</strong> Do you mean unbound data?</p>
<p><strong><a href="#39" title="2012-08-16 17:00:11">Cezar</a>:</strong> I guess my question is. How do you have bound data that&#39;s not validated? I thought is_valid() is what bound it?</p>
<p><strong><a href="#40" title="2012-08-21 12:13:01">tsaylor</a>:</strong> The data is bound when you instantiate the form with a dictionary in the first parameter. At that point the data can be found in form.data, and validating moves it to form.cleaned_data.</p>

        <content type="html" xml:base="http://www.timsaylor.com/" xml:lang="en">
            <![CDATA[ <p>I just saw this post on Stack Overflow about some <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10760326/merge-multiple-lines-in-vim/10760494#10760494">clever vim commands</a> and as a vim user  I was glad to learn some new tricks I can use.  Then I read the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/u4yzl/the_perfect_time_to_use_daft_punk_as_an_example/c4sg10d">reddit comments</a> about the story and found this (screencapped in case that link changes):</p>
<p><img src="/static/2012/Screen-Shot-2012-05-26-at-9.47.44-AM.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>When writing software the code is written once but probably read dozens of times.  Therefore, readable code is very important.  This is one of the central tenets of Python.  These commenters are debating whether readability is equally as important with Vim commands as it is in programming languages.</p>
<p>Previously I would have sided with the advocates of Vim&#39;s terse command syntax without much thought.  Short commands are easier to type and can be more effective.  However, this thread made me reconsider.  Because of Vim&#39;s terse commands, they are harder to learn and to remember.  And once a command is learned, it may be learned as a magical incantation and not a sequence of instructions, so the components won&#39;t be learned and reused for other needs.  So unless a Vim user spends a considerable amount of time learning commands, they&#39;ll be using the editor inefficiently and getting less done than they could because of Vim&#39;s terse commands and steep learning curve.  I&#39;m no longer sure that the efficiency gained by having short, easy to type commands is worth the efficiency lost by having a large set of hard to remember commands in your brain, and an equally large set that you aren&#39;t using because you don&#39;t know them.</p>
<p>Python has a relatively small syntax.  Most things are explicit so there aren&#39;t a bunch of implicit things you have to remember to know what your code is doing.  The advantage that gives a developer is that they can write code more quickly without having to look up syntax rules or function calls all the time.  Also, a new developer can come to the code and will understand the program more quickly with fewer things to learn.  As I thought about Vim&#39;s command complexity, it occurred to me that we already have a command set that&#39;s easy to write, read, and remember, and it&#39;s quick and easy to write a short script like the one in that Stack Overflow comment: Python!  Why can&#39;t Vim use Python to edit the working document?  The <a href="http://orestis.gr/blog/2008/08/10/scripting-vim-with-python/">Python scripting support</a> is a good start for complex add-ons, but why not make it even more integrated with things like :find(&#39;query&#39;) instead of /query?  I&#39;m very curious if a readily accessible, full blown python interpreter would make my vim use more effective.</p>
<p>P.S.  Emacs? </blasphemy></p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Comments</h2>
<p><strong><a href="#34" title="2012-06-06 02:35:21">Scott</a>:</strong> This sounds a lot like advocating tacking on a scripting interface to the driver controls in a car because it&#39;s hard to learn to drive without practice and justifying it by saying that the scripting interface makes driving skills more readable.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#35" title="2012-06-07 10:08:20">tsaylor</a>:</strong> The difference between driving and vim is that almost all the controls on a car are physical, so by looking you can see what&#39;s available. That&#39;s more like a GUI interface, and this sort of UX problem is why GUIs were invented. There are software car controls, and even non-obvious physical ones, but they&#39;re all less essential features. Anyone can get in a car with an automatic transmission and start driving it, but they may have to ask or look for the lights and wipers (which is a bit frustrating, but tolerable).</p>
<p><strong><a href="#36" title="2012-08-16 16:58:41">Cezar</a>:</strong> If you had such a car, and you put that scripting interface on it. That bucket of awesome would be called the Emacs.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#37" title="2013-01-09 15:38:11">Brian Madigan</a>:</strong> The good thing about vim is that MOST of what you do with it day-to-day is pure muscle memory. The bad thing about vim&hellip; there is no bad thing about vim. Generally you have to learn emacs or vim. I started with emacs, but to do basic commands required what I felt to be unnatural contortions of the hands. Vi is more ergonomic, at least for me. You don&#39;t need to know 100% of what&#39;s available in Vi, just enough to use it for your own purposes.</p>

        <content type="html" xml:base="http://www.timsaylor.com/" xml:lang="en">
            <![CDATA[ <p>I just had a formset where each form had a pre-loaded ModelChoiceField, and I needed to display the name of the selected choice in the template.  On a model you would just use the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/instances/?from=olddocs#django.db.models.Model.get_FOO_display">get_FOO_display()</a> method, but a form has no such convenience.  I found a number of almost solutions on Stack Overflow, and after poring over them I concluded the best solution for my problem was to add the following method to the form: </p>

<pre><code>class QuestionLanguageForm(forms.Form):
    ''' basic QuestionLanguage form '''
    language = forms.ModelChoiceField(queryset=Language.objects.all())
    short = forms.CharField()
    place_holder = forms.CharField()
    long = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea(attrs={'rows':None, 'cols':None}))

def get_language_name(self):
    ''' returns the name of the selected language '''
    try:
       return Language.objects.get(id=self.initial['language']).name
    except:
       return None</code></pre>
<p>This way I can use </p>

<pre><code>{{ form.get_language_name }}</code></pre>
<p>in my template and it prints the human readable name of the language set in my initial data.  This code is not robust; I catch all exceptions and ignore them because I&#39;m only using it in a circumstance where this code won&#39;t raise an exception (and in case it does, at least it won&#39;t fail catastrophically).  However proper error handling could be added pretty simply.  #ExerciseForTheReader P.S.  The title says &ldquo;selected&rdquo; value but I&#39;m actually using a pre-loaded value, not anything user selected.  If you need to get a user selected value you could use self.data or self.cleaned_data instead of self.initial.</p>

        <content type="html" xml:base="http://www.timsaylor.com/" xml:lang="en">
            <![CDATA[ <p>I just searched for a method to convert a model instance to a dictionary in Django and the top few results were a bunch of custom methods in Django Snippets and Stack Overflow.  I was about to use one of those when I clicked on one last link that showed me <a href="https://yuji.wordpress.com/2008/11/21/django-quick-note-from-irc-model-instance-to-dictionary/">a better solution</a>.  There is a method already built into Django that does exactly what I want: <a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/forms/models.py#L95">django.forms.models.model_to_dict</a>.</p>
<p>As I pointed that out to a coworker, he showed me that that&#39;s basically the same output as <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#values">the .values() method in the queryset api.</a>  If you don&#39;t specify a value to retrieve, it will retrieve the whole model instance as a dictionary. </p>
<p>Here&#39;s the output of these two pieces of code: </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Q.objects.filter(id=6).values()
[{'short': u'oui', 'deleted': False, 'language_id': 3L, 'long': u'oui', 'place_holder': u'oui', 'id': 6L, 'question_id': 8L}]
&gt;&gt;&gt; model_to_dict(Q.objects.filter(id=6)[0])
{'short': u'oui', 'language': 3L, 'deleted': False, 'question': 8L, 'long': u'oui', 'place_holder': u'oui'}</code></pre>
<p>There are two differences here, and one of them is pretty important.  First, .values() turns a queryset into an iterable that yields dictionaries, and model_to_dict turns a model instance into a single dictionary.  As long as you know about it this is pretty trivial to overcome.  Second, .values() converts foreign keys to {&#39;<field_name>_id&#39;: #} and model_to_dict converts them to {&#39;<field_name>&#39;: #}.  Since my purpose in using this was to populate a form I had to convert the id&#39;s into model instances and update the dictionary.  Not a big problem, but a bigger annoyance to solve than the first difference.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Comments</h2>
<p><strong><a href="#30" title="2013-03-14 15:19:47">ray</a>:</strong> Thanks for this. Saved me a lot of work I was about to get into.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#31" title="2013-07-24 14:29:09">jorgwel</a>:</strong> Hi, thaks for this info. Another difference between the two ways you mention, is that &ldquo;model_to_dict&rdquo; do returns details about ManyToMany fields, and &ldquo;.values()&rdquo; doesn&#39;t.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#32" title="2015-01-27 07:32:57">Vinay Kotian</a>:</strong> Hello, Thank you for the solution which has indeed helped. But now I am in a situation where i need all the dictionary from the queryset to be converted to string form rather than in unicode format({u&#39;abc&#39;: #}). Please let me know a solution thank you.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#33" title="2015-03-01 11:07:30">tsaylor</a>:</strong> You should use the json library to convert your dictionary to a json string.</p>

            <![CDATA[ <p>I couldn&#39;t find a good simple explanation of what this error means on the web, so to future googlers, you&#39;re welcome.</p>
<p>This most likely means that the user made a web reqeuest, probably through ajax, on your site and then cut off the connection before the ajax request completed.  The connection can be cut off by clicking on another link, closing the browser, or things in the middle like firewalls and whatnot.</p>
<p>There isn&#39;t a good solution to this issue that I could find, the error is just something that happens from time to time.  If it happens regularly and you don&#39;t think it&#39;s an accidental connection cut off, do some more exploring (particularly with firewalls and other potential connection problems), otherwise it can be ignored.</p>

            <![CDATA[ <p>I&#39;ve been doing some exciting things in the world of commerce. After <a href="http://www.pumpingstationone.org/">Pumping Station: One</a> got a laser cutter I started cutting stuff from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a> and thinking of products I could make with it.  I fixed the Thingiverse files for Tetris blocks and made some of those.  Then I thought of making glasses out of the <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/%E0%B2%A0%E0%B2%A0-look-of-disapproval">Look of Disapproval</a> from reddit.  Then Gretchen wanted me to make her something on the laser, so I made her a pendant with the kiss emoticon.  After a while I put all these things on my etsy store, <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/opticalawesome">Optical Awesome</a>.  The <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/79821028/look-of-disapproval-glasses">Look of Disapproval Glasses</a> started really taking off, and I&#39;ve now sold over 150 of them!  Exciting stuff.  I&#39;ve decided to move all my e-commerce to etsy since they make it so easy and deliver me traffic through their search.</p>
<p>I also sold things at Maker Faire NY, which was great.  My necklaces and t-shirts were big hits and I just about made enough money to cover the expenses of the trip. (Lesson #1, don&#39;t dig so big a hole that you have to have a ton of success to get back out of it.)  I kept track of a few things I started out doing wrong and did my best to fix on the spot, so hopefully those mistakes won&#39;t happen again: </p>

<ol>
<li>Post a price or people don&#39;t know it&#39;s for sale.  With all the makers just exhibiting things, it&#39;s easy to get confused.</li>
<li>If you put t-shirts out on a table people will look through them for their size.  Either have sizes out there or hang them up behind you.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t underestimate the number of women there.  I didn&#39;t think necklaces would sell well, but a ton of women came by and loved them.</li>
<li>People loved trying on the look of disapproval glasses and sending pics to their friends.  If I had a kiosk to do that it would be nice for collecting emails.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also I got a bunch of new product ideas from people coming up to my table.  I haven&#39;t acted on them yet, soon though!</p>

            <![CDATA[ <p>For years my efforts have been scattered between various projects. I have too many things going on at once and it&#39;s hard to keep it all straight and get anything meaningful done. When I stop to think about it, I <em>want</em> to focus on one thing at a time and make bigger, more awesome things happen, but I have a few major areas of interest with little overlap and I tend to go around in circles. Until now I&#39;ve just dealt with it and forced my way through bouts of disinterest, but after watching <a href="http://fora.tv/2011/05/22/Get_Inspired_with_MythBuster_Adam_Savage_at_Maker_Faire">Adam Savage&#39;s speech</a> at Maker Faire San Mateo 2011 along with a few other coinciding events I&#39;ve been driven to re-evaluate the things I&#39;m doing and why I&#39;m doing them. </p>
<p>I think the fundamental problem is that I&#39;m doing too many things that I&#39;d be good at or that would be beneficial and not enough of things that I love. I&#39;ve frequently heard the axiom that to be happy and effective at work you have to be doing what you love. I never really considered that very deeply. Ever since high school I&#39;ve known I wanted to write software for a living because I thoroughly enjoyed computers. As I grew in that through college I began to love writing web applications. Incidentally, I also really appreciated data mining and I&#39;ve kept that interest alive on occasion, but I largely abandoned that. I knew I needed to specialize and while the web and data mining often complement each other they are very different disciplines. That&#39;s probably the healthiest approach to this problem that I&#39;ve ever taken. </p>
<p>As I got my degree in computer science and continued marching toward becoming a software engineer another passion started growing: woodworking. I had liked building things like simple desks and furniture out of wood in the past but I never took it seriously. As I worked harder at software, I was becoming more interested in making more complicated things from wood and making them higher quality. I didn&#39;t have much guidance in that discipline so I ended up like any typical modern suburban man might; I bought a gaggle of tools that I didn&#39;t know how to use in an attempt to compensate for a lack of knowledge. Ultimately I gave up without making anything noteworthy, but my passion for making things never went away. It was a different facet of the same passion that brought me to programming in the first place. While I was stuck unable to make things as well as I wanted with wood, computers enabled me to make things without needing any particular talent beyond an analytical mind and there were teachers at my schools who could help me along in my development. </p>
<p>After graduating college I continued improving as a software engineer. I met with local user groups about Linux and Python, I designed and wrote applications in my spare time for the joy of solving interesting problems and for the sake of improving my skills as a developer. I progressed professionally and was pleased with the success I had. I continued carrying a torch for making things - keeping some of my tools in my apartment even though using them there would be extremely impractical. (Not that that always stopped me!) I even rented a garage at one point and kept my tools there so I could build more things. I made a collapsable hammock frame that failed dismally but had some design features I&#39;m still proud of. I made a computer chair that struck a balance between reclining for comfort and sitting up for serious work. I made a small shelf for my then girlfriend&#39;s bathroom and an &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; Guy Fawkes mask box. These things were all very simple due to my limited woodworking skill, but they were very rewarding to make. They also weren&#39;t too distracting from my course as a software engineer. There were more things I wanted to make that were too impractical for me to do, like make an aluminum foundry or a steam engine, but I knew these were well beyond my reach not for a lack of skill but that I believed they couldn&#39;t be done in a city like Chicago. </p>
<p>Then I was introduced to the concept of a hackerspace. Specifically, to Pumping Station: One, a hackerspace that was just beginning. It was essentially a group of dozens of people very similar to me. People who had modern jobs related to making things but were dissatisfied with the limitations they&#39;d experienced on their ability to produce their ideas. Many were even programmers who wanted to explore more tangible mediums for making. I knew this was a community that I needed to be a part of, and joining the hackerspace did turn out to be a great decision, but it also became a huge challenge. The hackerspace movement was rising around the country but it didn&#39;t come from nothing; the DIY mindset was increasingly popular in general and more things that appealed to a maker mindset were springing up. These things provided lots of inspiration to a group like our hackerspace. Too much inspiration in fact, at least for me. Initially I did end up building my aluminum foundry, but all the while countless these inspirational projects would cross our mailing list and would get added to my to do list, and I got overloaded. There were things from a wide range of disciplines that I wanted to sample to see if I could do them. I eventually had to prioritize, but the new ideas always seem like the greatest and most important ones so prioritization too often devolved into jumping into the new thing with the last one half finished. I&#39;ve been proceeding like that for a year or two, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve really made much that I&#39;m truly proud of since the aluminum foundry. </p>
<p>At the same time, programming became more of a job than a passion. With so many tangible things that satisfied my passion for making I became less interested in software. I stopped going to user group meetings. I occasionally wrote software to scratch my own itch but most of it wasn&#39;t very interesting. My skills continued developing, but only where my job took them. I wasn&#39;t working with new exciting tools because the time I would have spent on those was now being spent with wood and metal at the hackerspace. </p>
<p>This state of endless things to do is very demoralizing. I always had five or six projects on my mind and not enough time to complete them. That lead to having to force myself to work on things that I feel like I should be happy to be able to do. I&#39;d lost my motivation to do things that I used to love doing. I even lost the motivation to do some of the basic necessities. And it was hard to recognize what&#39;s going on because on the face of it I was doing exactly what I want to be doing, but it wasn&#39;t fulfilling. I should have been happy, but I wasn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Now to bring this back to where I started, I believe the problem of the endless to do list and constant new project distractions came from not knowing myself well enough to know when to say no. There are huge swaths of maker projects that interest me, and the way I interact with them through the internet they are cut down into easily digestible articles and videos. I love seeing things like that so I think I should make it to learn more about how it works and see if I can do it. That’s a huge mistake. There’s a tremendous difference between liking an article about something and liking something enough to spend dozens to hundreds of hours working on it. To do the latter, it has to be something that you really love doing and have a strong passion for. This is something that is obvious to anyone who thinks about it but is not so obvious to consider in the moment, at least for me. I’m learning that if an idea excites me, it may be because it’s an important idea for the world, or that it’s a fantastically executed example of what it is, or just that it’s something I haven’t seen before. Those are all great qualities for something to have, but none of them are good enough by themselves for me to commit myself to it. I have a lot of interests but I only have a few passions, and passion is what drives you through the hours of labor producing substandard junk until you get good enough at something that you can appreciate the product of your work on its own merits.</p>
<p>As I continue to make things, be they atoms or bits, I’ll be paying much closer attention to my motivations and I’ll be culling projects that are the product of fleeting interests and focusing on labors of love. I expect that this will leave me with more time, a clearer mind, and a more fulfilled life.</p>
<p>P.S. Much of this insight came from a combination of sources. One of them was a cognitive crisis when I worked hard to get makertees.com ready for maker faire and I didn’t seem to get the response I expected. The rest were well timed readings and that speech from Adam Savage, linked here again for convenience.</p>

            <![CDATA[ <p>When people put up an encrypted text puzzle online it is frequently a simple substitution cipher whereby each letter stands for a different letter and the plaintext is revealed by discovering the correct replacements for each letter. I always wondered if it was possible to automatically decrypt these puzzles by analyzing the frequency with which each character appears and compare that to the frequency of each character in the english language. (Obviously I&#39;m only decrypting english text, otherwise how would I know when it&#39;s right? Regardless, this code will work equally well for any language.) Recently I decided to test the theory. The code is below.  </p>

If you're like me, you may recall Trumpet Winsock, that nifty little bit of software that provided an interface from windows to the TCP/IP protocol stack that people all over the world used to connect to the internet for the first time. 

So, it turns out, the guy who made this didn't make crap off his work. Trumpet Winsock was stolen and actively given away on install disks from all the major tech magazines and in corporate installs. He was just a small time guy and his company had no way to fight the rampant theft. 

His name was Peter Tattam. Someone on reddit thought it'd be a good idea to start a donation pot to see if folks would pony up for the software that made it possible for them to get to the big wide web. I did. :) 

So, go on by if you used it, toss a chip or two in. It's a nice thing to do.
'''

print &quot;Contractions&quot;
contractions = set()
for word in cipher.split(' '):
    if &quot;'&quot; in word:
        contractions.add(word)
print contractions

print &quot;\nSingle Letters&quot;
singles = set()
for word in cipher.split(' '):
    if len(word) == 1:
        singles.add(word)
print singles

print &quot;\nLetter Frequency&quot;
cipher = cipher.lower()
charlist = list(cipher)
chardict = {}
for i in charlist:
    if i in list('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'):
        chardict[i] = chardict.get(i, 0) + 1
charlist = zip(chardict.values(), chardict.keys())
charlist = sorted(charlist, key=lambda x: x[0])
charlist.reverse()
for j,k in charlist:
    print j, k


print &quot;\nStatistical Frequency Plaintext&quot;
intab = ''.join([x[1] for x in charlist])
outtab = 'etaoinshrdlcumwfgypbvkjxqz'[:len(intab)]
plain = string.translate(cipher, string.maketrans(intab, outtab))
print plain</code></pre>
<p>I immediately encountered a major problem with one of my assumptions: various sources disagreed on the frequency of letter occurrence in the english language. I always thought those numbers were well established since people widely regard &ldquo;E&rdquo; as the most common letter, and Pat Sajak has sworn by &ldquo;RSTLN&rdquo; for decades. Also, most ciphertexts are far too small to make frequencies very relevant. In fact, the example I originally started with didn&#39;t even include all 26 letters.</p>
<p>After a few tries, this approach didn&#39;t work. It may be a useless approach because any text large enough for statistics to matter would probably not use a simple substitution cipher. However it was a fun experiment and a negative result is still a result worth sharing.</p>

            <![CDATA[ <p>BARcamp Chicago 2010 wrapped up a couple weeks ago, and it was a great success.  Last year was the first time that Jason Rexilius, the founder of BARcamp Chicago, took a smaller role in planning the event and as a result it was a bit rocky.  This year we got a better start on planning, got enough sponsorship to cover all our costs, and were well organized enough that nobody had to run around putting out fires all weekend.  There were definitely some areas where we could improve for next year, particularly in marketing and managing content, and we&#39;re already working on ways to do better. One of the things I was most looking forward to at BARcamp this year was BARcompany.  We&#39;ve tried to foster entrepreneurship in the past but there hasn&#39;t been much success.  This year we had five teams start to build something, and three made it through to present their idea.  The winner was <a href="http://www.ruggedscents.com/">RuggedScents</a>, a campfire scented cologne put made <a href="http://chemhacker.com">Sacha De&#39;Angeli</a> and myself.  Check out his write up of <a href="http://www.chemhacker.com/2010/08/a-funny-thing-happened-at-barcamp/">how the idea came about</a>.  This is why I&#39;m not building a Hero&#39;s Fountain anymore: I was only focusing on that to make a kit that I could sell, but since RuggedScents fell in my lap there&#39;s no need to work on the fountain.  I&#39;ll still get back to the fountain and other kit ideas I have eventually, but for now RuggedScents looks promising!</p>

            <![CDATA[ <p>By the end of August, I intend to build a working <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_fountain">Hero&#39;s Fountain</a>.  I made my first attempt the other day.  It didn&#39;t work, but I identified a number of ways I can improve it for my next attempt. Below is the test apparatus.  It uses a plastic bowl and two milk jugs for the water vessels.  The nozzles are pieces of copper tubing and are attached with plumber&#39;s epoxy.  The hoses are simple nylon (I think?  The material for that isn&#39;t really important.) tubing and are attached to the nozzles with twist ties. </p>
<p><img src="/static/2010/2010-08-07-203247.jpg" alt="Hero&#39;s Fountain Apparatus 1"/></p>
<p><img src="/static/2010/2010-08-07-203339.jpg" alt="Hero&#39;s Fountain Apparatus 1 Internal"/></p>
<p>The first mistake was using the plumber&#39;s epoxy. I used it because it&#39;s simple and fast and I&#39;d seen it used successfully in a similar application before. Unfortunately, after I was half done attaching the nozzles I saw the instructions said it&#39;s not recommended for use with polyethylene, which is what milk jugs are made of. As you can see, the epoxy didn&#39;t bond with the milk jugs, which broke the air seal. This is most visible on the leftmost nozzle in the picture above. Beyond that first failure the rest is more speculative.  My apparatus has both lower chambers at the same height, which means the water has a long way to rise from the blue topped milk jug to go through the fountain spout at the top.  The air moving between the pink chamber and the blue chamber will rise much easier, so I believe raising the blue chamber to shorten this distance will improve performance. Also, it takes a substantial amount of water to fill the tubes between the chambers, at least compared to the amount of water in the red bowl.  Priming the tubes with water would probably improve performance, but hopefully that will prove unnecessary. Finally, as the water drained from the red bowl I didn&#39;t consider that it would form a vortex.  That pushes some air down the tube as well as water.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a problem, in fact it might make the machine run a little longer, but it&#39;s something I will pay attention to in my next attempt.</p>

            <![CDATA[ <p>Today a coworker showed me a very easy way to test django code that sends emails.  It&#39;s straight from the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/email/#testing-e-mail-sending">documentation</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another approach is to use a &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; SMTP server that receives the e-mails locally and displays them to the terminal, but does not actually send anything. Python has a built-in way to accomplish this with a single command: </p>

<pre><code>python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025</code></pre>
<p>This command will start a simple SMTP server listening on port 1025 of localhost. This server simply prints to standard output all e-mail headers and the e-mail body. You then only need to set the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#setting-EMAIL_HOST"><code>EMAIL_HOST</code></a> and <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#setting-EMAIL_PORT"><code>EMAIL_PORT</code></a> accordingly, and you are set.</p>
</blockquote>
