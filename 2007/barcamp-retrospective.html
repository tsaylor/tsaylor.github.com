        <p>I never had a post-BarCamp update, and I don&#39;t really intend to do much of one now, but I do want to highlight a few things in case you didn&#39;t see them elsewhere and for myself in the future.   </p>
<p>BarCamp was lots of fun. There were quite a few good talks. There was also disappointingly too little coding. I will definitely do it again next year, and I&#39;ll prepare something more substantial than the non-talk I did this year on old technology. My non-talk proved very popular, lots of people were standing around as I demonstrated my ballista, and lots of people got the opportunity to play with it. I also made it in to all the videos I&#39;ve seen from the event. Here they are:  </p>
<p>BusinessPOV&#39;s <a href="http://www.businesspov.com/article/236">documentarian approach</a> to covering the event.  </p>
<p>Some random guy&#39;s youtube video of <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=iOmzh67uKgQ">SpecialKevin firing the ballista</a>.  </p>
<p><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=u30BJW9eG5w">The best idea ever.</a></p>
