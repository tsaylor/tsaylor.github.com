  I wanted a simple way to make a website and keep it updated that was easier than writing html
  directly and didn't have server software I'd need to keep updated, so I built a new, very simple
  static site generator.

    I've had a website for a long time - as a software developer and internet citizen I've felt
    like I need some kind of online presence and when I started this was the best way to do that.
    I've made that site with manual html, Wordpress, a custom Django blogging app, Jekyll, and a
    similar tool called Liquid Luck, and all of them were either overkill for what I was trying to
    do or made it too hard to publish something. Most web publishing is based on blogging, which I
    don't actually want to do. I just want a few pages that show things I've made or that I like or
    think are important (a portfolio, a personal home page, etc.). When you remove all the features
    that people expect from a general purpose blogging app you can make writing and publishing web
    content a lot simpler and more focused on your content.

    Easybake uses a combination of semi-structured data, html templates, and markdown to define
    your web content and arrange it into the website structure you want. It can generate pages or
    snippets that you can include in other pages. It can include related styles, images, or other
    files. It does all this with very little code and few dependencies, and it can build and deploy
    to github pages using github actions. Adding a new page is as simple as writing some markdown
    for the content and yaml to define where it should appear in your site, then pushing it to git
    and a few moments later it appears on the web. I used it to build this site, and you can see
    the source for it [here](https://github.com/tsaylor/tsaylor.github.com/tree/source).

    You can find more details in the
    [readme on github](https://github.com/tsaylor/easybake/blob/master/README.md).
