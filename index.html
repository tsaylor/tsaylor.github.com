                    <h3>Icebox for Chrome</h3>
                    <p>I wanted to build a tool that safely stored web sites I wanted to revisit
                    without keeping a tab open. Open tabs take up resources and clutter your mind.
                    I wanted to make it decentralized too, not aggregate all the data in a server.
                    As I kept working on this, the idea of "small data" was clarified in my head.</p>

                    <h3>Save This For Me</h3>
                    <p>I wanted to build a place to store things I had read that seemed valuable,
                    and I wanted it to help me revisit those things to always keep them in mind.
                    This website was an MVP of that idea.</p>

                    <h3>Ordclub</h3>
                    <p>I wanted a better way to get to know people at an event so I know who to
                    seek out and talk to. Given a twitter list of event attendees, this app makes
                    it easy to browse their bios and see who you want to make sure you meet. Future
                    plans included recommendations based on tweeted keywords and links.</p>

                    <h3>Ron May Facts</h3>
                    <p>When I co-ran BARcamp Chicago I met Ron May, a technology reporter who was
                    infamous for his abrasive personality, micro-casette recorder, and insistence
                    on getting your business card. After the event we were joking around about him
                    in the style of "Chuck Norris Facts" and eventually made this website. Ron was
                    a big fan!</p>
