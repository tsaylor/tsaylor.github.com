title: Ordclub
body: I wanted a better way to get to know people at an event so I know who to seek
  out and talk to. Given a twitter list of event attendees, this app makes it easy
  to browse their bios and see who you want to make sure you meet. Future plans included
  recommendations based on tweeted keywords and links.
