        <p>I&#39;m currently working for a company that uses the LAMP application stack. They have only had one full time programmer since they started, and he&#39;s a cowboy. They don&#39;t use much of a database abstraction layer, they mix their display code with their business logic, they don&#39;t do any testing, and even worse than not using source control at all, they sometimes use source control.   </p>
<p>I&#39;m starting a new project that will be fairly large and independent from the rest of the site, so I&#39;d like to introduce some better development practices. I don&#39;t know much about php frameworks and stuff, so if you have any suggestions for what I should use please post them in the comments. The only major requirement is that it can be used along side the existing code. So what do you suggest?</p>

<p><strong><a href="#18" title="2008-07-09 22:57:00">Anonymous</a>:</strong> cake? ask luca about webhp</p>
<p><strong><a href="#19" title="2008-07-10 05:39:00">Cezar</a>:</strong> Yea, I&#39;ve heard cake is good. Make sure you get an ORM. That&#39;s pretty much essential. Try getting them to let you use mercurial. And honestly. If they are high traffic and have no tests, then that&#39;s a huge mess.</p>
